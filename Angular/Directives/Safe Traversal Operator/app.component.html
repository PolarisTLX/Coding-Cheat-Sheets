<!-- useful to avoid errors when dealing with complex objects -->

<!-- <span>{{ task.assignee.name }}</span> -->
<!-- in a scerver scenario, data in objects might be null at times, which will break the program
    to solve this, only display this element if the item in the object is NOT null with *ngIf: -->
<!-- <span *ngIf="task.assignee">{{ task.assignee.name }}</span> -->

<!-- can also be accomplished with "safe-traversal-operator"  a  " ? " : -->
<span>{{ task.assignee?.name }}</span>
