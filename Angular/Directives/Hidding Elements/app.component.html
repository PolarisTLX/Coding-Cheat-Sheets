<!-- SHOW / HIDE div based on criteria with
 *ngIf and ng-template   OR   [hidden] -->

<!-- only one of these divs will be created to teh DOM-->
<!-- <div *ngIf="courses.length > 0">
  List of courses
</div>
<div *ngIf="courses.length == 0">
  No courses yet
</div> -->

<!-- Angular 4 version of above: -->
<div *ngIf="courses.length > 0; then coursesList else noCourses"></div>
<ng-template #coursesList>
  List of courses
</ng-template>
<ng-template #noCourses>
  No courses yet
</ng-template>


<!-- Best to use *ngIf when there are a lot of elements and children elements,
to reduce the number that are created and observed
(easier to read when inspected, less resources, faster) -->

<!-- [hidden] best for small/simple element trees -->
<!-- *ngIf for larger/more complex element trees
UNLESS BUILDING LARGE TREE WHILE USER IS INTERACTING IS RESOURCE COSTLY, THEN STILL USE [hidden]-->

<!-- SHOW / HIDE div based on criteria with "hidden" attribute -->
<!-- NOTE in this method, BOTH divs will be present in the dom when inspected
    one will simply have the hidden attribute and not show in the browser -->

<div hidden>
  List of courses
</div>
<div [hidden]="courses.length == 0">
  List of courses
</div>
<div [hidden]="courses.length > 0">
  No courses yet
</div>
