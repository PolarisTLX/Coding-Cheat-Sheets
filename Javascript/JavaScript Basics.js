Type Coercion / Automatic Type Conversion:

When Javascript is supplied incompatible balue types,
it quietly tries to convert them to being compatible.
This doesnt always work well:

console.log(8 * null);  // 0
console.log("5" - 1);   // 4
console.log("5" + 1);   // 51
console.log("five" * 2);  //  NaN
console.log(false == 0);  //  true


"===" (compare while being strict with the type):

console.log( 0 === false); // false



null / undefined / infinity / NaN / false:
3 values that are considered "numbers" in JS but dont behave like normal numbers:
    1. Infinity
    2. -Infinity
    3. NaN

//NOTE Infinity must be written with a capital I!!
console.log(Infinity == Infinity);  // true
console.log(Infinity == infinity);  // Error


console.log(null == undefined);  // true
console.log(null == 0);    // false
console.log("" == false);  // true
console.log(0 == false);   // true

console.log(NaN == NaN);   // false
(This is the only value in JS that is not equal to itself. Because a nonsensical computation is not equal to another nonsensical computation)
console.log(NaN != NaN);   // true


How to get NaN?
Any numeric operation that doest yield precise numeric results:
console.log(0 / 0);  //NaN
console.log(Infinity / Infinity);  //NaN


Most operators are binary (they take 2 values to complete their "function"):
Examples:

Unary Operators:  (takes only 1 value to complete their "function"):
"typeof"
console.log(typeof  "x");    // string
console.log(typeof  8);      // number
console.log(typeof  false);  // boolean
console.log(typeof  yes);    // undefined (booleans are only true or false)

Ternary Operator (takes 3 values to complete their "function")
there is only one example of this, it is the  " ? : "
true ? 1 : 2




"Escaping the character" with backslash (\):
To include a '' or "" inside of another string:
'That don't impress me much'  (does not work)
'vs
'That don\'t impress me much'  (works)

Newline character: \n:
"This is the first line\nThis is the second line".
// "This is the first lines
// This is the second line."

If two \\ follow each other, tey collapse together:
"A newline character is written like \"\\n\" properly."
gives result:
"A newline character is written like "\n" properly."

Otherwise:
"A newline character is written like "\n" properly."
gives result:
X Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid


Letters/strings can be compared, since all characters are given an internal asigned number for Unicode:
"b" is higher (comes after) "a" in this order.
console.log("a" < "b");
console.log("A" < "B");
console.log("Andrew" < "Mandrew"); // true
console.log("Andrew" < "Bndrew"); // true

//NOTE - Had this wrong before!
Uppercase letters come BEFORE??? lowercase letters in this order:
"A" is lower (comes before) "a" in this order.
console.log("APPLE" < "apple");  // true
console.log("a" > "A");  // false
console.log("b" > "A");  // true!!!
console.log("b" < "A");  // false!!!


Operator Order Of Precence / order of execution:
||  has the lowest precedence (executed last)

(paretheses)  -->   "* / %"  -->  "+ -"    -->   (comparisons (>, >=, ==, != ..)  -->   &&   -->   ||



When you call on a variable that has not been assigned a value, it returns "undefined"
var tricycle = 3;
console.log(tricycle); // 3
var bicycle;
console.log(bicycle); // undefined

defining multiple values at a time with one statement, simply use a comma:
var one = 1, two = 2, three = 3;


//Not very useful?
an alternative to the browser popup "alert("good morning");"
can be confirm("Do you accept?");  //this has a pop up with TWO buttons, Cancel and ok
can be prompt("How do you plea?", "...");  //this is same as Confirm, but with a text input field first

var pickedNumber = Number(prompt("Pick a number", ""));
alert("Your number x 3 is: " + pickedNumber * 3);

Only doing this if the number typed is a valid number:
if(!isNaN(pickedNumber));
if(!isNaN(pickedNumber)) { alert("That's a valid number!"); } else { alert("That's not a valid number!"); }

curly braces {}  they are ACTUALLY only needed if an if or else statement has more than one statement to perform.
most use them at all times since you may need to add more statements later, thus would need to add curly braces.



do/while loop is basically a while loop that will perform the first action at least once, regardless of if a further condition is met or not.
This example will prompt once, and then keep prompting until the user provides a response:
    do {
      var yourName = prompt("Who are you");
    } while (!yourName);
    console.log(yourName);


// looking at the for loop, you can take out the middle state as so if you like. It does the same thing:
// (not that it's desireable)
for (var current = 20; current % 7 ==0; current++) {
}
console.log(current);
// OR :
for (var current = 20; ; current++) {
  if (current % 7 == 0)
    break;
}
console.log(current);
// â†’ 21
