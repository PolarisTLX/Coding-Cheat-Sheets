which types of things Ruby considers "true" and which ones it considers "false".

"Truthiness" and "Falsiness" are ways of saying
"what evaluates to true?" and "what evaluates to false"?

In many languages, there is some nuance to that question.

In Ruby, its simple: nil and false are false and thats it.
Everything else is "truthy".
